Minimal Functional Dependency Set

Functional dependencies (FDs) derived from the schema:

1. PersonID → gender, birth_date, first_name, middle_name, last_name, address_id, occupation, contact_number, rank, department, family_contact, physical_description, arrest_status, harm_details, testimony
2. address_id → street_address, city, state, postal_code, country
3. {case_id, open_date} → crime_date, end_date, complaint_detail, crime_type, crime_location, case_status, PersonID
4. {case_id, open_date, trial_number} → hearing, judge_id, court_level
5. evidence_id → description, collection_date
6. {case_id, open_date, PersonID} → fine, jail_start_date, jail_end_date, death_penalty
